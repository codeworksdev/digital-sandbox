# Veeva.js
_Add Veeva CLM compatibility to Mochi._

> [v1.0](https://github.com/codeworksdev/mochi/blob/master/dist/mochi/js/plugins/veeva/CHANGELOG.md)

This drop-in extension allows you to quickly develop a **[Veeva CLM application](https://www.veeva.com/products/multichannel-crm/clm/)** within Mochi while maintaining full Veeva CLM compliance. It fully utilizes the **[Veeva JS library](https://cdnmc1.vod309.com/clm/release/veeva-library.js)** and includes special API calls that interface directly with the platform.

## CHANGELOG

> **1.0** (2018-06-07)
> - Initial release.
